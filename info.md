# Volkswagen We Connect ID

This integration is only for the 'ID' cars from Volkswagen.

## Examples

My car is called Komo, and you will see that name in the examples. 
Replace the entities with the corresponding entities from your car.

Start warming up the cabin when it's freezing outside
```yaml
- alias: Car - Start preheating the cabin when it's freezing
  id: 4008ba82-bb35-4b2f-85b3-96dca152efd1 # Make this unique
  trigger:
    - platform: time
      at:
        - "07:00:00"
  condition:
    condition: numeric_state
    entity_id: weather.torentje
    attribute: temperature
    below: 1
  action:
  - service: volkswagen_we_connect_id.volkswagen_id_set_climatisation
    data:
      vin: WVGZZZE2ZMP4201337
      start_stop: start
      target_temp: 20
```

_My advice is to create a seperate automation for when the car actually starts heating up, the VW api is really slow and not really bullit proof._

Send messsage when car is heating up:
```yaml
automation:
- alias: Car - Notification when car started to heat up the cabin
  id: 919b5fbf-b1c7-41ec-a31f-3c9a14785bf0 # Make this unique
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.volkswagen_id_komo_climatisation_state # Change entities
      to: "heating"
  action:
    - service: notify.mobile_app_mitchells_ifoon_app # Change entities
      data:
        message: "ðŸ”¥ Komo is heating up the cabin to {{states.sensor.volkswagen_id_komo_target_temperature.state}}Â°C. It's done at {{ (now()|as_timestamp + (float(states('sensor.volkswagen_id_komo_remaining_climatisation_time')) * 60 ))|timestamp_custom('%H:%M', True) }}." # Change entities or change the message
        data:
          url: "/lovelace-car/car"
          push:
            thread-id: "car-group"
```

Send messsage when car is done charging:
```yaml
- alias: Car - Notification when car is done charging
  id: 22a8347c-4001-4795-a3de-71a89a428806 # Make this unique
  trigger:
    - platform: template
      value_template: "{{ states.sensor.volkswagen_id_komo_state_of_charge.state == states.sensor.volkswagen_id_komo_target_state_of_charge.state }}" # Change entities
  action:
    - service: notify.mobile_app_mitchells_ifoon_app # Change entities
      data:
        message: "ðŸ”‹ Komo is done charging, current range is now {{states.sensor.volkswagen_id_komo_range.state}}km." # Change entities
        data:
          url: "/lovelace-car/car"
          push:
            thread-id: "car-group"
```

Send messsage when car has an error while charging:
```yaml
- alias: Car - Notification when car errored
  id: 791366e0-df10-465a-8706-30017d08ea91 # Make this unique
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.volkswagen_id_komo_charging_state # Change entities
      from: "charging"
      to: "error"
  action:
    - service: notify.mobile_app_mitchells_ifoon_app # Change entities
      data:
        message: "ðŸš¨ Komo has an error while charging with {{states.sensor.volkswagen_id_komo_range.state}}km range." # Change entities
        data:
          url: "/lovelace-car/car"
          push:
            thread-id: "car-group"
```

Send messsage when car started charging:
```yaml
- alias: Car - Notification when car started charging
  id: dadf86c7-fd05-4aff-9891-e3d9f1eaf4dc # Make this unique
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.volkswagen_id_komo_charging_state # Change entities

        data:
          url: "/lovelace-car/car"
          push:
            thread-id: "car-group"
